<h1 align="center"> Community Resilience Network </h1>

## Problem Statement

In the face of increasing climate-related disasters and other
emergency situations, building resilient communities is paramount.
We seek innovative solutions to develop a comprehensive
Community Resilience Network (CRN) - a digital platform designed
to empower communities in preparing for, responding to, and
recovering from disasters. Participants are tasked with designing and
developing a web and mobile application that fosters community
collaboration, provides critical information, and facilitates disaster
preparedness and response. The CRN should encompass the
following features:

1. Provide `automated alerts and notifications` for various types of
disasters, including weather-related events, natural disasters, and
emergencies, along with safety recommendations.
2. Develop a `comprehensive directory` of local resources, including
emergency shelters, medical facilities, and community support
organizations.
3. Allow users to `report incidents`, hazards, and emergencies
in real-time, with `GeoLocation` and multimedia capabilities.
4. Implement `role-based access control` for community members,
local authorities, and emergency responders, each with specific
permissions.
